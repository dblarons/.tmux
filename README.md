My Tmux Configuration
============

This is my personal tmux configuration. I have remapped C-b to C-a, made the status
bar look nice with powerline, and added a few other niceties. I navigate with
C-a l and C-a h.

### Install

Install the following programs after setting up tmux.

1. `reattach-to-user-namespace`: For copy-pasting between tmux and the system
   clipboard.

   `brew install reattach-to-user-namespace`
